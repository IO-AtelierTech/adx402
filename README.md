# Adx402

**Frictionless**, **on-chain** advertising for the open web.

Adx402 is a **Web2.5 advertising protocol** that connects brands and publishers
through **Solana** and **x402**, enabling fair, automated ad placements. No
accounts, no middlemen, minimal friction. It merges the accessibility of Web2
with the transparency and incentives of Web3.

## ✨ Overview

Adx402 lets:

- **Brands** publish ads directly from their wallet, registering a unique `brand:wallet` pair on-chain.

- **Publishers** embed a simple script or web component to serve ads dynamically, earning rewards for verified impressions and engagement.

- **The protocol** matches ads and publishers using smart contracts + agentic automation, with AI-powered content filtering to keep the network clean.

## 🎮 Incentive Design

- **No signups**. The wallet is the identity.

- **Stake-based moderation**. Brands pay a slightly higher fee on first post; subsequent ads cost less if the brand maintains good standing.

- **Reputation-aware** filtering. Ads from flagged or spammy wallets are deprioritized or banned.

- **Publishers** earn proportional rewards to verified traffic (not fake localhost clicks).
